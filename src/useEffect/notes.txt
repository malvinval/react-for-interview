1. Basically when we use useEffect hook, we want to run "side effect" whenever something happened.
2. useEffect expect 2 parameters.
    The first one (required) is a function that will be called.

    The second one (optional) is array of dependencies.
    - If second parameter not passed, useEffect will be executed everytime component rendered.
    - If second parameter is empty array ([]), useEffect will be executed once when the first time component rendered.
    - If second parameter is array of dependencies ([name, number]), useEffect will be executed only when those states are modified.
