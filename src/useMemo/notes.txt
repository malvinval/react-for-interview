1. useMemo is a hook that allows you to memorize a value returned from slow computations.
   They are only recomputed when one of their dependencies changes.
   This can help improve performance, especially if you have expensive calculations that are performed frequently.

2. useMemo expect 2 parameters.
    The first one (required) is a function that will be called.
    The second one (optional) is array of dependencies.
