1. useMemo is a hook that allows you to memorize a value returned from slow computations.
   They are only recomputed when one of their dependencies changes.
   This can help improve performance, especially if you have expensive calculations that are performed frequently.

2. useMemo expect 2 parameters.
    The first one (required) is a function that will be called.
    The second one (optional) is array of dependencies.

Here's an example of using useMemo to memoize a computed value in a React functional component:

function MyComponent({ data }) {
  const expensiveValue = useMemo(() => {
    // Do some expensive computation here
    return data.reduce((acc, item) => acc + item, 0);
  }, [data]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Expensive value: {expensiveValue}</p>
      {/* Render the rest of the component */}
    </div>
  );
}

In this example, MyComponent receives a data prop, which is an array of numbers.
We want to compute the sum of all the numbers in the array, but we don't want to repeat this computation unnecessarily on every render.
So we use useMemo to memorize the computed value.

The first argument to useMemo is a function that does the expensive computation.
In this case, we're using the reduce method to sum up all the numbers in the data array.
The second argument to useMemo is an array of dependencies.
If any of the dependencies change, the memoized value will be recomputed.
In this case, the only dependency is the data prop.

Now, whenever the data prop changes, useMemo will recompute the expensiveValue and return the memoized value.
Otherwise, it will return the previously computed value without re-executing the expensive computation.
